# Changelog

All notable changes to PIX Football. Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), versions: [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-21 — "First Steps"

### Added
- Unity 6 HDRP project (D3D12, linear color, 1440p default), Input System, Cinemachine 3.
- **Main menu** built from the PIX UI kit: PIX PRO FOOTBALL LEAGUE shield, Free Roam / Settings / Quit, Xbox glyph footer, full gamepad navigation, the composer's own soundtrack rotating in the background.
- **Settings**: resolution, display mode, quality, invert look, default camera, lighting, master/music/crowd volume (saved).
- **Stadium_Pro** scene: full pro stadium with regulation field (120 × 53⅓ yd), NFL-height goal posts, pylons, yard markers, benches, hydration stands, chain crew.
- **Night game** (16 floodlights, volumetric fog) and **day game** lighting presets with broadcast-style color grading (ACES, bloom, SSAO, SSR, contact shadows, light motion blur, film grain).
- **25,817-fan crowd** (billboard fans baked from the crowd characters, 8 clothing palettes).
- **Free Roam**: one controllable player driven by the PIX momentum engine — ratings-based acceleration, speed-dependent turning, plant-and-cut speed loss, stamina-limited sprint.
- **Ball-carrier moves**: juke L/R, spin, stiff-arm L/R, truck, hurdle, dive, protect ball, celebrate — mocap animation layer over a locomotion blend tree.
- **Cameras**: broadcast sideline (2K-style), behind-the-player, and first-person helmet cam; cycle with View.
- **Uniforms** in all 32 team color sets; cycle teams from the pause menu.
- HUD: team crest, speed (mph), stamina bar, controls legend that switches between Xbox and keyboard glyphs.
- Pause menu: Resume, Camera, Lighting, Uniform, Quit to Menu.
- Football rules engine (pro + college rule sets, downs, clock, scoring, overtime, 16 penalties), playbook with ~195 offensive / ~70 defensive plays + special teams.
- League layer: official 32 pro teams (Liberty & Frontier Conferences), 138-school college world with 10 conferences and 41 bowls, regen player generator, scouting, draft, offseason, quick-sim box scores, seasons, awards.
- 22-player on-field simulation (blocking, routes, coverage, pursuit, catching, tackling) — wired into full games in v0.2.0.
- 357 automated EditMode tests; `-pixAutotest` smoke-test mode in the player build.

### Changed
- All Draft Fever branding replaced with PIX PRO FOOTBALL branding (wall pads, banners, video boards, end zones, jerseys, props).

### Known Issues
- Midfield league logo is oversized (spans 40 to 40); will be scaled to regulation size.
- Night lighting is a little dim compared with a real broadcast.
- Crowd is static (no animation or team-color sections yet); soft up close.
- No walk or spin mocap exists in the source set: walk is a slowed jog, spin is procedural.
- Ball is not yet carried in the player's hands; no goal-post/wall collision.
- Some head models and logo source files still carry real-person / real-school names internally; to be replaced before Steam.
